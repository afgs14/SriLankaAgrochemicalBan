# SriLankaAgrochemicalBan
Data, R script and Excel spreadsheet for my fourth year master's project (University of Oxford, MBiol): Investigating the potential consequences of Sri Lanka's agrochemical ban for biodiversity and human nutrition.

I carried out almost all of the analysis in R, but I used Excel for most of the weighted spread scenario calculations.
